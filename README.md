# App introduction:
This is a triathion tracking app.
Track the meals and how are we eating for the specific day, as well as how many hours' sleep we get.
If you didn't log in for the specific day, you would get a notice saying that "Hey, don't forget to log in for your day."
When you selected for a day, you would get every day's data from that day on as well as that day's data.
Also there is button for resetting and clearing out the infomation.
We can add new entry for a new day.
If you come to the add entry screen after you logged your information, you would get a view as an emoji and a phase for today as "Hey, you already logged for today", and a reset button.
The last screen would be like a real time tracker, it's going to tell you which way you are currently heading as well as your altitude and your speed that you are going. e.g., a simulator set to simulating a drive on a freeway.

Whenever you have the text, you wrap that into the text component.
